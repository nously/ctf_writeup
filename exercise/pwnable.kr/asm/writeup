1. since I am new to assembly language, I modify existing assembly code here:
http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-878.php

2. make an assembly listing, so that we can look at the binary opcode.
to make assembly listing, I use this:
nasm read.asm -l read.lst

3. make a simple python screen which can devide bytes with "\x"

4. make a python script with pwntools.
